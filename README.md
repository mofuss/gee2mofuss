⚠️ We are in the process of significantly upgrading this code to support the integration of various aboveground biomass maps and a novel dataset on regrowth functions at the pixel level. We anticipate having a fully functional version by mid-2025.⚠️

In the meantime, you can run MoFuSS using the globally available datasets.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact aghilardi@ciga.unam.mx.
